### **Key Changes Made**
**Database Schema:**

- ✅ Made `phone` column required with placeholder system
- ✅ Updated database functions (`create_admin_user`, `promote_user_to_admin`)
- ✅ Removed @mol-coffee email pattern restrictions
- ✅ Updated triggers to auto-generate placeholder phone numbers

**Authentication Flow:**
- ✅ **Simplified Registration** - Only email + password required initially
- ✅ **Progressive Profile Completion** - Name + phone collected on first login
- ✅ **Auto Email Confirmation** - All users auto-confirmed via trigger
- ✅ **Placeholder Phone System** - Generates unique placeholder phones (`+84000000XXX`)
- ✅ **Profile Completion Modal** - Appears when name/phone incomplete
- ✅ **Vietnamese Phone Validation** - 10-digit mobile number validation

**Frontend Implementation:**
- ✅ Updated `AuthContext` with profile completion checking
- ✅ Created `ProfileCompletionModal` with Vietnamese phone validation
- ✅ Simplified `LoginPage` to only collect email + password on signup
- ✅ Added `useUpdateUserProfile` mutation hook
- ✅ Implemented phone validation utilities
- ✅ Updated employee management to display phone numbers

**Benefits Achieved:**

### **Registration Flow:**
```

2. Database trigger creates profile with placeholder phone
3. User logs in successfully
4. ProfileCompletionModal appears if profile incomplete
5. User provides name + phone (validated)
6. Profile updated, modal disappears
7. User proceeds to dashboard
```
