The Settings Management system provides comprehensive admin controls for configuring coffee shop operations, including work activities and hourly rates with effective dating. This feature enables dynamic pricing and operational flexibility.

## Core Features

### Activities Management
- **Work Activity Types:** Define different types of work (Coffee, Bread, Management, etc.)

- **Vietnamese Localization:** Default activities in Vietnamese

### Rates Management
- **Activity-based Hourly Rates:** Set different rates for different work types
- **Effective Dating:** Historical rate tracking with date-based transitions
- **Rate History:** Complete audit trail of rate changes
- **Vietnamese Currency:** VND formatting and Vietnamese number display

### Data Management
- **Persistent Storage:** Automatic database synchronization
- **Cache Invalidation:** Intelligent data refresh and background sync
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure handling with user feedback
- **Optimistic Updates:** Immediate UI response with automatic rollback

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Activities Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.activities (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
);
```

#### Rates Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.rates (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    activity_id UUID REFERENCES public.activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    hourly_vnd INTEGER NOT NULL,                     -- Vietnamese Dong
    effective_from DATE NOT NULL,
    effective_to DATE,                               -- NULL = current rate
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT rates_effective_period_check CHECK (effective_to IS NULL OR effective_to > effective_from)
);
```

### Default Vietnamese Activities
Seeded during initial setup:
- **Thá»­ viá»‡c** (Trial work) - 20,000 VND/hour
- **CÃ  phÃª** (Coffee service) - 22,000 VND/hour
- **BÃ¡nh mÃ¬** (Bread/food service) - 25,000 VND/hour
- **Quáº£n lÃ½** (Management) - 28,000 VND/hour

### Rate Effective Dating Logic
```sql
-- Get current rate for activity
SELECT hourly_vnd FROM rates
WHERE activity_id = ? AND effective_from <= CURRENT_DATE
  AND (effective_to IS NULL OR effective_to > CURRENT_DATE)
ORDER BY effective_from DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Historical rate lookup for specific date
SELECT hourly_vnd FROM rates
WHERE activity_id = ? AND effective_from <= ?
  AND (effective_to IS NULL OR effective_to > ?)
ORDER BY effective_from DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## Business Rules

### Activity Management Rules
1. **Unique Names:** Activity names must be unique across the system
2. **Archive vs Delete:** Activities are archived (soft delete) to preserve historical data
3. **Status Control:** Inactive activities cannot be assigned to new shifts
4. **Data Integrity:** Activities with existing shifts cannot be permanently deleted

### Rate Management Rules
5. **Effective Dating:** Rates must have valid effective date ranges
6. **Non-overlapping Periods:** No overlapping effective periods for same activity
7. **Current Rate Identification:** Only one active rate per activity at any time
8. **Historical Preservation:** Old rates preserved for payroll calculations
9. **VND Currency:** All rates stored and displayed in Vietnamese Dong

### Access Control Rules
10. **Admin-Only Access:** Settings management restricted to admin users
11. **Role Validation:** Database and UI enforce admin-only access
12. **Real-time Security:** Role checks enforced on all mutations

## API Reference

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Get all active activities
SELECT * FROM activities WHERE is_active = true ORDER BY name;

-- Get current rate for activity
SELECT r.* FROM rates r
WHERE r.activity_id = ? AND r.effective_from <= CURRENT_DATE
  AND (r.effective_to IS NULL OR r.effective_to > CURRENT_DATE)
ORDER BY r.effective_from DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Get rate history for activity
SELECT * FROM rates WHERE activity_id = ? ORDER BY effective_from DESC;
```

### Frontend Hooks
```typescript
// Activities management
const { data: activities, isLoading } = useActivities();
const { mutate: createActivity } = useCreateActivity();
const { mutate: updateActivity } = useUpdateActivity();
const { mutate: toggleActivityStatus } = useToggleActivityStatus();

// Rates management
const { data: rates } = useRates();
const { mutate: createRate } = useCreateRate();
const { mutate: updateRate } = useUpdateRate();

// Settings context
const { isAdmin } = useAuth(); // Access control
```
