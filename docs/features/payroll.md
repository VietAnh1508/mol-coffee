## Overview

The payroll system provides comprehensive salary calculation and management based on scheduled work shifts. It features role-based access control, period management, and Vietnamese currency formatting for coffee shop operations.

## Core Features

### Schedule-Based Payroll Calculation
- **Direct Calculation:** Uses `schedule_shifts` table as source of truth (simplified approach)
- **Effective-Dated Rates:** Applies correct hourly rates based on work date and activity
- **Activity-Based Tracking:** Separate hour tracking and rate calculations per activity
- **Vietnamese Currency:** Proper VND formatting with Vietnamese number localization

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Access:** View all employees' salary data and manage payroll periods
- **Employee Access:** View only own salary data with automatic redirection
- **Data Isolation:** Database-enforced privacy via Row Level Security

### Period Management
- **Monthly Periods:** Organize payroll by month (YYYY-MM format)
- **Period Locking:** Prevent schedule changes after payroll finalization
- **Admin Audit Trail:** Track who closed/opened periods and when
- **Status Tracking:** Open/closed period management

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Payroll Periods Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.payroll_periods (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    year_month VARCHAR(7) UNIQUE NOT NULL,           -- Format: YYYY-MM
    status payroll_status DEFAULT 'open' NOT NULL,
    closed_by UUID REFERENCES public.users(id),     -- Admin who closed period
    closed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT payroll_periods_closure_check CHECK (
        (status = 'open' AND closed_by IS NULL AND closed_at IS NULL) OR
        (status = 'closed' AND closed_by IS NOT NULL AND closed_at IS NOT NULL)
    )
);
```

### Payroll Calculation Logic
```sql
-- Calculate monthly salary for user
SELECT
  u.name,
  SUM(EXTRACT(epoch FROM (ss.end_ts - ss.start_ts))/3600) as total_hours,
  SUM(EXTRACT(epoch FROM (ss.end_ts - ss.start_ts))/3600 * r.hourly_vnd) as total_salary_vnd
FROM schedule_shifts ss
JOIN users u ON ss.user_id = u.id
JOIN rates r ON ss.activity_id = r.activity_id
WHERE u.id = ? AND DATE_TRUNC('month', ss.start_ts) = '2025-09-01'
  AND ss.start_ts >= r.effective_from
  AND (r.effective_to IS NULL OR ss.start_ts <= r.effective_to);
```

#### Month Boundary Handling
- PostgreSQL stores `schedule_shifts.start_ts`/`end_ts` as `timestamptz`. To keep payroll periods aligned with Vietnam's local month we apply the `VN_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_MINUTES` (UTC+7) constant when building the ISO date range in `createMonthDateRange`.
- The range is shifted by the offset before converting to ISO, so filtering on `start_ts` with `.gte(start)`/`.lte(end)` returns exactly the local month's shifts while still catching overnight jobs that finish after midnight.

### Vietnamese Currency Formatting
```typescript
// Format: 25.000 ‚Ç´ (Vietnamese Dong formatting)
const formatMoney = (amount: number) =>
  new Intl.NumberFormat('vi-VN', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'VND'
  }).format(amount);
```

## Business Rules

### Payroll Calculation Rules
1. **Salary = sum(scheduled hours √ó applicable rate per activity) + allowances**
2. **Effective-dated rates:** Use rate valid for the work date
3. **Activity-based calculation:** Different rates for different work types
4. **Lunch allowance eligibility:** Employees working ‚â•2 shifts in a day receive the daily lunch allowance sourced from `allowance_rates` (with safe client fallback)
5. **Monthly organization:** Payroll calculated per calendar month

### Period Management Rules
6. **Payroll locking:** Closed periods prevent schedule changes
7. **Admin audit trail:** Track who closes/reopens periods
8. **Period uniqueness:** One period per month (YYYY-MM format)

### Access Control Rules
9. **Role-based visibility:** Admins see all data, employees see own data only
10. **Database-enforced privacy:** RLS prevents unauthorized access
11. **Auto-redirect:** Employees automatically go to their detail page

## API Reference

### Database Functions
```sql
-- Calculate total salary for employee in month
SELECT calculate_monthly_salary(user_id, 'YYYY-MM');

-- Get payroll period status
SELECT status FROM payroll_periods WHERE year_month = 'YYYY-MM';

-- Close payroll period
UPDATE payroll_periods
SET status = 'closed', closed_by = ?, closed_at = NOW()
WHERE year_month = 'YYYY-MM';
```

### Frontend Hooks
```typescript
// Payroll calculations
const { data: payrollData } = usePayrollCalculations(yearMonth, userId);

// Period management
const { data: periods } = usePayrollPeriods();
const { mutate: createPeriod } = useCreatePayrollPeriod();
const { mutate: lockPeriod } = useLockPayrollPeriod();

// Salary data
const { data: salaryBreakdown } = useSalaryBreakdown(yearMonth, userId);
```
